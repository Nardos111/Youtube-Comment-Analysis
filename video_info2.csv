https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGwP22mH44,YOU WONT BELIEVE THIS IS ACCRA GHANA | REAL LIFE OF LOCAL GHANAIANS LIVING IN GHANA,"#ACCRAGHANA #LIFEINGHANA #LIVINGINGHANA #GHANA  #ghanatouristattractions I explored a township within the Accra region of Ghana called Teshie. Its an interesting area to visit as there is such a big contrast between Teshie and the main parts of Accra. In this part of Ghana, most of the people still practice their traditions and culture. They still have a chief, a priest and a shrine.  This area is a high crime area but can serve as a great tourist site given that its so accessible within Accra, there is so much culture to learn and is generally safe during the day.  Most people who are from the Ga tribe of Ghana originate from this area.Natural Skin and Hair Care Site: https://www.lusciousskinandhair.com  (WORLDWIDE SHIPPING)Subscribe to my channel here : https://www.youtube.com/jjasminesw?su...
