https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLDlO2CIMbQ,How to Make Ethiopian Injera- Ferment Teff Flour,"This is how I make Injera. Make sure all of the water that goes into this is warm- not too hot not too cold. this process of fermentation takes 5 days in total but nutritiously filling!In the video I put the salt and baking powder while fermenting. I've been getting a lot of spiteful comments that this should not be done this way, so I tried putting the salt and baking powder in right before cooking and it works so much better. Thanks for the tips even though they have been quite mean. I like to put salt in things because it brings out the flavor and the baking powder helps it rise. Though, I must say this can give you a start on how it should be done, It's not perfect but it's still good.I make a Berbere spiced lentil curry to go along with this- the recipe is in the description!
