3,LINDA AURORA VOU CHORAR LINDA DEMAIS AMEI MUSICA PERFITA,849
3,"Es hermosa, espero que más personas le den la oportunidad a aurora, ella hace música muy hermosa.",192
3,"These should be the proper lyrics, but you never know... you never know...

I run from the liars

The fuel on the fire",323
3,This song screams positivity and an anthem. Aurora truly is out of this world and her songs are a representation of what she stands for. Aurora is the cure for all of her warriors and weirdos and she is the cure for all things Good and Bad !!! Love you Momma,224
3,"Essa mulher literalmente me salvou desde que comecei a ouvir suas músicas, a cada lançamento é um sopro de vida novo <3 Minha Hécate",27
3,"On Spotify the storyline says:
""Sometimes I feel like the whole world is trying to convince you something is wrong with you.
And sadly, often people believe this to be true.
It is very scary how easy it is for someone to convince you that you are wrong.",938
3,"As músicas da Aurora são tão perfeitas, e algo que posso dizer que é como se fosse uma marca registrada dela é que cada música tem um estilo totalmente diferente",14
3,"essa mulher é de outro mundo, não é possível aurora",54
3,Incrível como essa mulher consegue ser perfeita em tudo oq ela faz,41
3,"Suena diferente a todo lo que ha hecho antes, aunque comúnmente la relaciono con música de estilo tribal, esto me suena muy movido, LA AMOOOO",16
3,In a world full of hatred and negativity. Aurora and her songs are like the eternal elixir of life. Helping everyone carry on with their lives. She is indeed a cure for all of us.,647
3,"Meu deus do céu que perfeição, essa mulher não é humana, é um anjo",6
3,"Maybe Aurora is the only artist, who can make me want to be always updated about her songs. Wait for her live-streams. I feel at peace with her in this world full of self-serving, chaotic, sometimes a bit too selfish people. Whenever I feel numb, I see her and unconsciously my stress due to my values which people consider to be old-fashioned disappears. I want to be kind to people again and not ignore, while not burdening my mind and bottling up my emotions. Her every song is like portrayal of truth, but even most raw song has a bit of kindness, humanity and gratefulness hidden in it. I always feel like I let go of my resentments when I hear her songs. She is the artist I most appreciate......",10
3,I like the fact that a lot of her music is what everyone is kind of thinking but she is our voice on a public scale,96
3,"I'm not sure if anyone feels the same, but this makes me think of when people view my neurodivergence as a negative thing which is tragic and needs to be cured. Really, it's part of what makes me who I am and is not something to be ashamed of. :) This song truly didn't disappoint. It's completely different from anything else I've heard - Aurora really is the queen of surprises!",31
3,Ni si quiera la he terminado de escuchar y ya la amoooooooooooooooo,424
3,""" I don't need a cure for me""...I disagree because AURORA and her songs are a CURE FOR ME!!!",44
3,"This one is another masterpiece. Its a whole new style, always a bit magical, but it almost sounds like a game too, so funny and witty... yet the meaning is really deep: never forget who you are and don't let others manipulate you or tell what you have to become. Don't worry, in the world there's place for everyone; you are amazing because you are yourself. You don't need any cure and neither a mask. Stay safe and have a great day hearing Aurora's beautiful voice. ",35
3,AAAAAAAPERFEIÇÃO DIVINA MDSSSSSS NÃO TEM COMO,16
3,"Lyrics:-
I run from the liars, the fuel on the fire
I know I created myself
I know I can't fight the sad days and bad nights",29
3,"Quem é Aurora?

pro cego, é a luz
pro faminto, é o pão ",205
3,"Oof I love how playful and energetic this song is, my body is moving naturally to the beat ~~♡♡ the lyrics are also so validating. I always feel like something is terribly wrong with me and that I need to be fixed, because I never fit in with people. It's nice to hear a song like this",27
3,"my family always told me to not be too close to girls because people would think im whisper a lesbian.
i never cared about it but somehow i felt sad knowing people thinks i should be ashamed because of loving, now im happy, i met the love of my life, a pretty girl with a pretty heart that makes me proud of dont having any cure from this infection of a different kind, im happy hwehwh ",24
3,"To everyone out there who needs to hear it your identity is valid,your feelings are valid,love is the most beautiful thing we get to experience in this world and you have a bright future. You are doing amazing and there are people who love you and will love you unconditionally,I’m sure of it. Be proud of who you are and take care!There are beautiful things on the making for you!",9
3,"I was not expecting this sound at all, I am so shocked, she just decided to snatch my wig with a high kick.",9
3,"Tradução da letra 🇧🇷

Aurora - Cura para Mim",162
3,"Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I run from the liars, the fuel on the fire
I know I created myself",11
3,"I was having a breakdown because I’m so scared of my future and failure and of other’s opinions about me, and this song came out and I listened to it... I really needed to hear these words. It has reminded me of my growth and made me feel already better. I’m so thankful for this, for Aurora and also for being myself (even if it is the hardest thing to remember and say) ",33
3,"musica perfeita, so a aurora mesmo para fazer essas musicas perfeitas",4
3,+1 pra lista de musicas fodas da aurora,6
3,"Now this is what you call a unique touch. Aurora is an artist who knows how to make a song to have a bond with listeners. And this one is so funky. She is the only artist who don't listen to songs very often, but makes way awesome and touching songs than other artists. She's an angel that God has sent to this world to make people's lives better!",237
3,"Now when people tell me that im overly weird and crazy and that i should get that check i can simply respond ""I dont need a  cure for me"". Aurora has made another master piece about being yourself and living your truth. I love this song already, its so pleasing to listen to.",4
3,"Essa musica é muito diferente na qual eu imaginei, positivamente falando.

Aurora sempre perfeita e tocando nossos corações <3",4
3,"I think this is, by far, the most funky song Aurora has ever released and I'm loving it! I just love Aurora as artist overall this is why she makes me so excited about her new artistic directions. Also, her message on this song is beautiful!",5
3,It’s so beautiful- all of her songs seem so elegant in their own way.,23
3,"Ironically, after hearing this song I feel cured.",493
3,The ones who disliked this must have taken the cure,3
3,"Aurora with this new song:

Another day, another slay",4
3,"Wait a minute, this beat is actually sick af. Its giving me video game boss battle vibes. Love it Aurora",9
3,"Es una canción que al comenzar es bastante similar a muchas de las que hay ahí en el mundo, quizás por la forma en que AURORA utilizó su voz, pero la parte musical del estribillo hace que sea especial y diferente, porque es como juguetón. <3",14
3,"In a world of hate we are forced to swallow...there is AURORA telling us to be kind...especially to ourselves. We don't need a cure for the weirdo in us,  warriors... ♡♡♡",219
3,"I already replied to someone in the comments saying this, but I love the way she experiments with music. 
Sometimes a song can feel VERY different, even strange, but it still has that something that screams ""THIS IS AURORA"".",4
3,"I really liked the beats when Aurora finishes singing the lines ""But I don't need a cure for me"" it's like I am in a circus, being peculiar but it's okay. This is really a very powerful song. Thank you Aurora you really inspires people and brings love and hopes to the world.",1
3,Esperando só o video clip para narrar a história dessa deusa.,3
3,The melody in the chorus sounds like a some kind of gothic-indie carnival,1
3,This song is definitely the cure for me.,230
3,Outra música pra gente dançar estranho q nem a aurora. Perfeita ❣️,1
3,"Dios, esto es tan diferente a lo que normalmente Aurora hace y me encanta 💞",4
3,Incrível como ela consegue fazer músicas tristes e animadas ao mesmo tempo,3
3,"Uma vez a Aurora chutou a Terra e ela gira até hoje. Dona do mundo, te amoooo",1
3,"This is quite different from what I was expecting, but I am not disappointed. Aurora has this magical touch that makes you feel the music so deeply, like you're complete immersed in it. The beat and her heavenly voice are a world I want to live in forever",210
3,DEUSA AURORA TE AMO MEU AMOR QUE MUSICA PERFEITA LINDA DA MINHA VIDA,
3,"I can’t tell you how very excited I got seeing that Aurora had released a new song. No matter the beat, the sound, her beautiful perspective on life and her voice will always soothe me on my darkest days and bring a smile to my face!",3
3,Another amazing art-piece by this special bean. Aurora is capable of putting everything into one and making it dazzling. I love this concept🎭💫,3
3,"Tava puto no trabalho aqui, aí chegou notificação... No momento certo",2
3,The control she has over her voice is insane,228
3,"Artista completa veyy, trabalho muito singular e principalmente INSPIRADOR em todos os sentidos.",1
3,Aurora is so different from today’s singers I wished everyone could feel her music,1
3,Quando acabar a pandemia quero uma festa com essa música tocando pra dançar sob luzes coloridas.,1
3,Aurora have no idea how many lives she have saved just through her songs. I am so blessed by Mother Nature to live at the same time as her.,3
