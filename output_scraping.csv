0,"Mr minister, don't just tell people to live responsibly because many Ghanaians simply don't understand what that means. They only understand a strict enforcement of the laws so just go ahead and do that; then you will find that even the fools in the society will all fall in line. Simples 😁",4

I'm glad that you showed a community like this. I was surprised and this reminds how similar the 🇺🇲  are because where there are thriving cities communities like this exist all around cities here. Is that good or bad.....thats not for me to say. Would I live there...no. Could I live there absolutely yes. I am a man and could live and make it anywhere.  Peace to continue 🙏 following you.",5

2,"I was in Teshie  in  January, I met  some  real great down to earth people out there, real people. Other Ghanaians were telling me to  keep away, people are people, all these folks want is a bit of cash injection . I  grew up in the Caribbean were we butchered each other from simple things.

2,As We Move Showing African to the World 🌎 God bless you,17
2,Jasmine!😅 Clearly you were intimidated but you braved it up my Sweet Lady. Well done.,1
3,"In fact, most diasporas don't last in Ghana, because they don't know how to pace themselves financially. Paying for Uber instead of using the tro tro, eating out, and paying too much in monthly rent will burn you right out of Ghana.",11
3,"The YouTube bit had me in stitches. It seems everyone who locates does YouTube on how they love Ghana blah blah blah lol. Nothing wrong with it. But the number of people doing YouTube about ghana when they locate is very  high , it has become very competitive. We do appreciate them. But is good you highlighted it in this video, about the downside.",2
3,"Ghana is cheap if you live like the locals. But unfortunately, I have noticed that many diasporans want a certain kind of lifestyle which denands $$$$. Don't eat too much at restaurants; instead cook home meals; go to local markets to get groceries; take the trotros for transportation and not too much uber, taxis etc.; learn to wash your clothes with your hands; dry your clothes by hanging them outside allowing the sun to dry it for you; don't spend too much money on unnecessary things; live the African way.",12
3,"Dela, this is one of the best VID so far, keep it up, most people don't own anything in the WEST, the credit system give them false sense of ownership ooo!!!🤣🤣🤣I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE THIS. 😍👍🏾",9

3,"Practical advice,  very important",1
3,People need to know the truth,1
3,"Good stuff Dela. I am glad you presented the other side. Everything was on point. I have friends who repatriated and left after a few years, because of lack of planning. I was lucky. I had a soft landing, as I was recruited in the States by an American multinational company for a management position in Ghana. I always maintain that, if one owns a house and a car, then living a good and quality life in Ghana is attainable. A house and a car are huge overheads. If you can get these out the way and know where to buy your food, among other things, then Ghana is the place to be.",1
3,"Great advice, thank you!!!!!!!!!",1
3,I love Ghana Fanta lol. Great video for those of us moving soon:) Thanks for sharing!,3

3,"#2 is ridiculous anyways!  $1000 for rent, no way Jose’!  Been a home owner for years and I will never rent or have a mortgage again!  I’ve experienced both. Believe me I prefer no rent/ mortgage!  😩 Ps.  I’ll never build in Africa.  Looking at the expats who are building in Africa, nah, not me Charlie, not chale but Charlie. Ha! I would buy a home already built.",4
3,Great lecture.,

3,"And they think Africans in africa are poor!!! There is a market and consumers for £5 coca cola in Africa, believe it or not 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣!!!! Base on experience, nothing frighten me more than the blind and naive enthousiasm of the diaspora heading to Africa. That was a powerfull list of advices!! Good job👍👍👍👍👍👍",5
3,Renting is dead money,2
3,Number 1 if you rich you can live the lifestyle you want but If you are middle class or poor not so much In the end It all comes down to what your worth In Africa 30 to 60 thousand poor 100.000 to 400.00 middle class 500.00 to millions rich.,
